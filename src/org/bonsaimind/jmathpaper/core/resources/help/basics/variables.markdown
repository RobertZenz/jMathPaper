Variables
=========

jMathPaper allows to store results in variables by prefixing the expression with
the name of the variable and an equals sign:

    width                                width=5 =   5

The variable names must begin with either a lower- or uppercase letter or
an underscore, and can contain any letter, underscores or numbers. 

The following constants are available by default:
