==========

A simple and easy to use calculation application, which works similar to taking
notes on a sheet of paper.

Usage
-----

When you start jMathPaper you are greeted with a (currently empty) list of
previous expressions and the input box to enter a new one. You can enter any
expression you want to evaluate. Additionally, there is a larger input are to
the right which allows you to take notes. 

You can save and load papers from the menu, they are stored in a very simple
cleartext format, so it is easy to create and edit them without jMathPaper.

For example, let us start with something simple and enter a few simple
expressions:

    ID                        Expression    Result
    ----------------------------------------------
    #1                               1+1         2
    #2                               5*5        25
    #3                            239-39       200
    ----------------------------------------------

One of the big features of jMathPaper is that you can easily reference
a previous result by using its ID, like this:

    ID                        Expression    Result
    ----------------------------------------------
    #1                               1+1         2
    #2                               5*5        25
    #3                            239-39       200
    #4                             #2*25       625
    ----------------------------------------------

We can also define variables which we can reference:

    ID                        Expression    Result
    ----------------------------------------------
    #1                               1+1         2
    #2                               5*5        25
    #3                            239-39       200
    #4                             #2*25       625
    length                     length=10        10
    width                        width=5         5
    area               area=length*width        50
    ----------------------------------------------

Now if we made a mistake, for example the width really is 7, we can simply press
up and down to scroll through the history and execute the corrected expression
again. The previously executed expressions do not change, so we need to evaluate
them again:

    ID                        Expression    Result
    ----------------------------------------------
    #1                               1+1         2
    #2                               5*5        25
    #3                            239-39       200
    #4                             #2*25       625
    length                     length=10        10
    width                        width=5         5
    area               area=length*width        50
    width                        width=7         7
    area               area=length*width        70
    ----------------------------------------------

We can also use mathematical functions, like `sin`:

    ID                        Expression    Result
    ----------------------------------------------
    #1                           sin(70) 0.9396926
    ----------------------------------------------

See the documentation of [EvalEx](https://github.com/uklimaschewski/EvalEx/blob/master/README.md)
to see what functions are supported.

Additionally, we can also enter numbers in hex, octal or binary:

    ID                        Expression    Result
    ----------------------------------------------
    hex                         hex=0xff       255
    octal                     octal=0o77        63
    binary                   binary=0b11         3
    ----------------------------------------------


Technical information
---------------------

jMathPaper is a Java 8 application which uses SWT and EvalEx.

The save format is a simple plaintext format, with UTF-8 as encoding and UNIX
line endings. Everything from the start of the file to the first empty line is
treated as expression, everything below the first empty line is treated as note.
