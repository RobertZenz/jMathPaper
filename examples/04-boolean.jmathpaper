#1          1==1 = true
#2          2==1 = false
#3           2>1 = true
#4 true || false = true
#5 true && false = false

We can also work with boolean value. They are internally represented as 0 (false) and 1(true).

The following operations are supported:

 * Comparison: == < > <= >= !=
 * And: &&
 * Or: ||
